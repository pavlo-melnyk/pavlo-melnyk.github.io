## Welcome!

I'm a researcher in Computer Vision Laboratory, Link√∂ping University, Sweden, where I've obtained my PhD in Computer Vision (with focus on Geometric Deep Learning) supervised by Michael Felsberg. My research interests include equivariant neural networks, AI for science, and AI for good. I'm currently looking for postdoc opportunities.
