I had the honor of participating in the [PhD graduation ceremony](https://liu.se/en/academic-celebration) following the centuries-old tradition. It was exciting to share the stage with so many amazing people, including [Honorary Dr. Jensen Huang](https://liu.se/en/news-item/they-are-awarded-honorary-doctorates-2025).

I am grateful to Link√∂ping University, [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/), and my supervisor Prof. Michael Felsberg for making all this possible and for all the wonderful support throughout this journey.
