I successfully defended my [PhD thesis](/./phd_thesis/) at Link√∂ping University on September 27, 2024. It was an honor to have [Prof. Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/) from the University of Pennsylvania serve as my opponent during the defense. With this milestone, I've earned my doctorate in Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in Computer Vision.
