Had the honor of participating in the PhD graduation ceremony and confirming my doctorate following the centuries-old tradition. It was exciting to share the stage with so many amazing people, including Honorable Dr. Jensen Huang.

Grateful to Link��ping University, WASP – Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program, and my supervisor [Prof. Michael Felsberg]() for making all this possible and for all the wonderful support throughout this journey.
