"QuaMo: Quaternion Motions for Vision-based 3D Human Kinematics Capture" by Cuong Le, Pavlo Melny, Mårten Wadenbäck, and Bastian Wandt has been accepted at [ICLR'26]()
I successfully defended my [PhD thesis](/./phd_thesis/) at Linköping University on September 27, 2024. It was an honor to have [Prof. Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/) from the University of Pennsylvania serve as my opponent during the defense. With this milestone, I've earned my doctorate in Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in Computer Vision.
