      <title>O$n$ Learning Deep O$(n)$ Equivariant Hyperspheres</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:none;&#34;&gt; In this paper, we utilize hyperspheres and regular $n$-simplexes and propose an approach to learning deep features equivariant under the transformations of $n$D reflections and rotations, encompassed by the powerful group of $\text{O}(n)$. Namely, we propose $\text{O}(n)$-equivariant neurons with spherical decision surfaces that generalize to any dimension $n$, which we call &lt;em&gt;Deep Equivariant Hyperspheres&lt;/em&gt;. We demonstrate how to combine them in a network that directly operates on the basis of the input points and propose an invariant operator based on the relation between two points and a sphere, which as we show, turns out to be a Gram matrix. Using synthetic and real-world data in $n$D, we experimentally verify our theoretical contributions and find that our approach is superior to the competing methods for $\text{O}(n)$-equivariant benchmark datasets (classification and regression), demonstrating a favorable speed/performance trade-off. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steerable 3D Spherical Neurons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:none;&#34;&gt; Emerging from low-level vision theory, steerable filters found their counterpart in prior work on steerable convolutional neural networks equivariant to rigid transformations. In our work, we propose a steerable feed-forward learning-based approach that consists of neurons with spherical decision surfaces and operates on point clouds. Such spherical neurons are obtained by conformal embedding of Euclidean space and have recently been revisited in the context of learning representations of point sets. Focusing on 3D geometry, we exploit the isometry property of spherical neurons and derive a 3D steerability constraint. After training spherical neurons to classify point clouds in a canonical orientation, we use a tetrahedron basis to quadruplicate the neurons and construct rotation-equivariant spherical filter banks. We then apply the derived constraint to interpolate the filter bank outputs and, thus, obtain a rotation-invariant network. Finally, we use a synthetic point set and real-world 3D skeleton data to verify our theoretical findings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Embed Me If You Can: A Geometric Perceptron</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:none;&#34;&gt; Solving geometric tasks involving point clouds by using machine learning is a challenging problem. Standard feed-forward neural networks combine linear or, if the bias parameter is included, affine layers and activation functions. Their geometric modeling is limited, which motivated the prior work introducing the multilayer hypersphere perceptron (MLHP). Its constituent part, i.e., the hypersphere neuron, is obtained by applying a conformal embedding of Euclidean space. By virtue of Clifford algebra, it can be implemented as the Cartesian dot product of inputs and weights. If the embedding is applied in a manner consistent with the dimensionality of the input space geometry, the decision surfaces of the model units become combinations of hyperspheres and make the decision-making process geometrically interpretable for humans. Our extension of the MLHP model, the multilayer geometric perceptron (MLGP), and its respective layer units, i.e., geometric neurons, are consistent with the 3D geometry and provide a geometric handle of the learned coefficients. In particular, the geometric neuron activations are isometric in 3D, which is necessary for rotation and translation equivariance. When classifying the 3D Tetris shapes, we quantitatively show that our model requires no activation function in the hidden layers other than the embedding to outperform the vanilla multilayer perceptron. In the presence of noise in the data, our model is also superior to the MLHP. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
